## Abstract:

Our group sought to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh based on overall "livability". To do this, we looked at datasets for things like arrests, 311 requests, and playgrounds. We chose these things because we felt like they would all contribute to how comfortable a neighborhood would be to live in.

After getting our datasets and applying our metrics to them and assigning scores to neighborhoods, we came out with our winner. One thing to note however, is that there wasn't very much overlap between our datasets, with each one having a different set of top 10 neighborhoods. In the end, since we had weighted the arrest data higher than the others, the neighborhood that won by that metric won overall.

The best neighborhood in Pittsburgh, is **Mount Oliver Borough**
